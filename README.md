## Abstract
- Studentâ€™s attendances are taken manually by using attendance sheet, which is a time consuming event. Moreover, it is very difficult to verify each student in a large classroom environment with distributed branches whether the authenticated students are actually responding or not. As manual labor involved in this process is time consuming, an automated Attendance Management System (AMS) based on face detection and face recognition techniques is proposed.


## Technologies Used
- PyCharm
- Visual Studio


## Proposed System
- Developed Smart Attendance system for Government Aided School.
- Student database is created.
- Attendance will get updated in excel sheets. Present and Absentees list is recorded in separate excel sheet.
- Student attendance data analysis are generated for further improvement of the student.


## Features
- No separate software is needed-SaaS(Cloud Computing)
- Minimum time is spent for taking attendance
- Proxy of attendance will be avoided.
- Data Analysis can be done so that the Teacher work can be  minimized.
